## Heyy! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this game. Pls dont forget to give this project a ðŸŒŸ right up ðŸ‘†

This game was an advanced coding challenge I saw at [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rock-paper-scissors-game-pTgwgvgH). And I took it up and tweaked it. It's a really cool game to wear off stress.

## Update

I plan to make it more complex by making it **Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock**, tell me what you think on my [Twitter page here](https://www.twitter.com/I_am_Ajayii/)

### Rules

The game starts with a preset score of `3` points which reduces by `1` if you lose a round and adds `1` point if you win a round. You lose the game if the scrore reaches `0` and your win if it reaches `6`.

#### How do I know who wins a round?

- Paper beats Rock
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
